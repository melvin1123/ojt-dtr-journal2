# 🕒 Daily Time Record (DTR) System

## Overview
The Daily Time Record (DTR) module is designed to track intern attendance and work hours accurately. It eliminates manual computation by automatically calculating total rendered hours and monitoring punctuality through a user-friendly dashboard.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Real-Time Logging
Easily **Clock In** and **Clock Out** with a single click.

### Automatic Hour Calculation
The system automatically calculates total work minutes and converts them into a readable **Hours and Minutes** format.

### Attendance Statistics
A summary widget that displays:

- **Total Hours**: Your total accumulated work time.  
- **Total Days**: How many days you have reported for work.  
- **Overall Late**: Total time recorded for late arrivals.

### Session Management
Supports morning and afternoon sessions (e.g., logging out for lunch and back in for the afternoon).

## 📖 How to Use the DTR

### 1. Clocking In/Out
When you arrive at the office or start your shift:

1. Navigate to the **Daily Time Records** section.  
2. Click on the **Clock In** button to start your session.  
3. When your shift or session ends, click **Clock Out**.

### 2. Understanding Your Stats
At the top of your DTR page, you will see your **Stats Overview**. This updates automatically every time you log a session.
